<p>4. Historically, markets have experienced downturns, both short-term and prolonged, followed by market recoveries. Suppose you owned a well-diversified portfolio that fell by 20% (i.e., $1,000 initial investment would now be worth $800) over a short period, consistent with the overall market. Assuming you still have 7 years until you begin withdrawals, how would you react?</p>
